### Summary

##### Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that there did not appear to be positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. An additional analysis I'd perform with the dataset is determine the total number of 4-star reviews by both Vine employees and non-Vine employees to determine if positivity bias exist at a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating.
